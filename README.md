## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   A package manager of your preference

    -   <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable">Yarn</a>
    -   npm
- <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register">MongoDB Atlas</a> account

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository in the desired folder. You can do it by copying the https link, the ssh link or downloading the zip file:

-   cloning with https link:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kellysondias/events-api
```

-   cloning with ssh link:

```powershell
git@github.com:kellysondias/events-api.git
```

3. After the project has been downloaded, you can navigate to the project's directory and install the dependencies with a package manager of your preference:

-   Navigate to the project's directory:

```powershell
cd path\of\your\cloned\folder
```

-   <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable">Yarn</a> command:

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

-   npm command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (in the same level as `package.json`). You can find a more practical example in the .env.example file.

2. Set the variables as below replacing the `<>` fields with your information:

-   `MONGO_URI`: "This is where your MongoDB Atlas URI will be set to create a database connection"

-   `PORT`: "This is where you'll choose in which port your local host server will run"

    -   **_Note_**: if `PORT` is not defined, it is set to `3000` automatically

-   `JWT_SECRET`: "This is where you'll store your JWT secret string for creating user's validation"

    -   You can run the `openssl rand -base64 32` command to generate a secret string

**Example:**

```
MONGO_URI='<your_db_URI>'
PORT=<choose_a_port>
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret>
```

## Running the Server

After all this configuration is set and ready to go:

1. Run the app with the dev script.

-   Yarn command:

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

-   npm command:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

And now the API should be officially running :] .
